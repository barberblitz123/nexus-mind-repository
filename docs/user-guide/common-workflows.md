- Context-aware: Commands adapt to current file type
- Custom macros: Create your own command sequences

### Keyboard + Voice Hybrid
- Use keyboard for precise editing
- Use voice for high-level commands
- Switch seamlessly between both

### AI Learning
- NEXUS learns your patterns
- Improves suggestions over time
- Adapts to your coding style

### Time Savers
1. **Template Generation**: "Create React component with tests"
2. **Bulk Operations**: "Rename all instances of getUserData to fetchUserData"
3. **Smart Imports**: "Import all missing dependencies"
4. **Auto-formatting**: "Format all files in the project"

Remember: The best workflow is the one that works for you. NEXUS adapts to your style, not the other way around!
