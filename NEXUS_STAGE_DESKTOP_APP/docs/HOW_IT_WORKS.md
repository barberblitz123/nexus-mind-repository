# How NEXUS 2.0 Stage Manager + Desktop Manager Works

## 🎯 The Concept (Just Like Claude's Multi-Agent System)

When you chat with me and I say "I'll launch multiple agents", here's what happens behind the scenes:
1. I analyze your request
2. Break it into tasks
3. Create specialized agents for each task
4. They all work simultaneously
5. Results come back to our chat

**Your NEXUS 2.0 does EXACTLY this, but visually in your terminal!**

## 🖥️ What You're Actually Launching

### It's ALL Terminal-Based! (No Web Browser Needed)

## 🔄 How Tasks Flow

### 1. You Type in Chat (Desktop Manager)
```
You: "Create a web scraper for news sites"
```

### 2. System Automatically Creates Agent Windows
```
→ Creates "Developer Agent" window
→ Creates "Research Agent" window  
→ Creates "Test Agent" window
→ All appear in Stage Manager
```

### 3. Agents Work Simultaneously
```
Developer Agent: Writing scraper code...
Research Agent: Finding best practices...
Test Agent: Preparing test cases...
```

### 4. Results Show in Preview Panes
```
Preview 1: scraper.py (code being written)
Preview 2: research_notes.md (findings)
Preview 3: test_output.log (test results)
```

### 5. Updates Flow to Chat
```
Developer: "Created basic scraper structure"
Research: "Found 5 best practices to follow"
Test: "Ready to test when code is complete"
```

## 🔌 Everything is Interconnected

### Shared Memory
- All agents can access the same information
- When Research Agent finds something, Developer Agent can use it
- Test Agent knows what Developer Agent built

### Unified Terminal
- All output goes to the same terminal session
- Commands from any agent execute in shared environment
- File changes are immediately visible to all agents

### Synchronized State
- Agent windows update in real-time
- Chat shows all agent communications
- Preview panes update as agents work

## 💡 Example Workflow

### Your Input:
```
"Build a Python API with authentication"
```

### What Happens Automatically:

1. **Stage Manager Creates Windows:**
   - Developer Agent - Builds the API
   - Security Agent - Handles authentication
   - Database Agent - Sets up data models
   - Test Agent - Creates tests

2. **Desktop Chat Shows:**
   ```
   Developer: Starting Flask API setup
   Security: Implementing JWT authentication
   Database: Creating user model with SQLAlchemy
   Test: Writing unit tests for endpoints
   ```

3. **Preview Panes Display:**
   - `app.py` - Main API code
   - `auth.py` - Authentication module
   - `models.py` - Database models
   - `tests.py` - Test suite

4. **Everything Runs Together:**
   - All agents work simultaneously
   - They share discoveries
   - Code is integrated automatically
   - Tests run as code is written

## 🚀 What to Launch

### Option 1: Integrated Workspace (Recommended)
```bash
cd 01_NEXUS_2.0_AGENT/core
python nexus_integrated_workspace.py
```
This gives you the complete terminal UI with Stage + Desktop Manager

### Option 2: Task Orchestrator Demo
```bash
cd 01_NEXUS_2.0_AGENT/core
python nexus_task_orchestrator.py
```
This shows how tasks create agent windows

### Option 3: Individual Components
```bash
# Just Stage Manager
python nexus_stage_manager.py

# Just Desktop Manager  
python nexus_desktop_manager.py
```

## ❌ Common Misconceptions

### "Where's the web interface?"
- NEXUS 2.0 Agent System is **100% terminal-based**
- The web interfaces in `02_WEB_INTERFACES/` are different projects
- This is like tmux/screen but for AI agents

### "Do I need a browser?"
- No! Everything runs in your terminal
- It's a TUI (Terminal User Interface)
- Think of it as VS Code, but in your terminal, with AI agents

### "How do agents actually run code?"
- Each agent is a real Python process
- They can execute commands via subprocess
- They can write and modify files
- They can run tests and see results

## 🎯 The Power of This Approach

1. **True Parallelism**: Like my multi-agent responses, but visual
2. **Real Execution**: Agents actually run code, not just chat
3. **Shared Context**: All agents know what others are doing
4. **Terminal Native**: No browser overhead, pure terminal power
5. **Interconnected**: Changes in one place affect all agents

This is the REAL autonomous development environment - multiple AI agents working together in terminal windows, all connected, all collaborative!
