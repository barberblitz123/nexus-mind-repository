## 🏠 Your Current BlueHost Plan

**To determine compatibility, I need to know:**
1. **What BlueHost plan do you currently have?**
   - Shared hosting (Basic, Plus, Choice Plus, Pro)?
   - VPS hosting?
   - Dedicated server?

2. **What features does your plan include?**
   - SSH access?
   - Python support?
   - Database access?
   - Custom application hosting?

## 🔧 How to Check Your BlueHost Plan

### Method 1: BlueHost Control Panel
```
1. Log into your BlueHost account
2. Go to "My Products" or "Hosting"
3. Look for your plan name (e.g., "Basic", "VPS Standard", etc.)
4. Check if you see "SSH Access" or "Python" in features
```

### Method 2: SSH Test
```bash
# Try to SSH into your BlueHost account
ssh yourusername@yourdomain.com

# If this works, you likely have VPS or dedicated
# If it doesn't work, you likely have shared hosting
```

### Method 3: Python Test
```
1. Create a file called test.py in your BlueHost file manager
2. Add content: print("Python works!")
3. Try to access it via browser
4. If it works, you can run NEXUS Core
```

## 🚀 Recommended Approach

### If you have BlueHost Shared Hosting:
**Upgrade to BlueHost VPS** ($18.99/month)
- This will give you Python support
- Can run NEXUS Core consciousness engine
- Keep your existing domain and setup

### If you have BlueHost VPS/Dedicated:
**Perfect! You can run NEXUS immediately**
- Deploy NEXUS Core directly to BlueHost
- Use your existing domain
- No additional hosting costs

### If you want to save money:
**Use Hybrid Local + BlueHost approach**
- Run NEXUS Core on your local machine
- Use BlueHost for web interface and domain
- Set up dynamic DNS or tunnel service
